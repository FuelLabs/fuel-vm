Added a new `Owner` policy. The policy stores the index of the transaction input, which is nominated as the owner. In the case of multiple inputs with different owners, it helps to identify the owner of the transaction.
Added a new `GM::GetOwner` opcode, which retrieves the owner of the transaction. If the `Owner` policy is set, the opcode returns a pointer to the owner from the policy. If policy is not set, but all inputs have the same owner, it returns the pointer to the owner. Otherwise, it panics with `OwnerIsUnknown`.
