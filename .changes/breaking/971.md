All `Vec<u8>` fields in the transaction now use `Bytes` type. This type has truncated `Debug` string, and has optimized serialization and deserialization for `postcard` and `binacode` encodings. The new encoding is compatible(was tested) for `serde_json`, `bincode`, `postcard`.
`StateTransition` and `StateTransitionRef` now contains `Verifier` generic from the VM.
