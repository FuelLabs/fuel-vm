Increased performance of the postcard bytes serialization and deserialization in 40 times.
Increased performance of the canonical bytes deserialization in 200 times.
`Contract::id` method now a static function, instead of the method of the instance.
Remove `impl TryFrom<&Create> for Contract` implementation for the `Create` transaction. Instead, use `Create::bytecode` to get the contract bytecode.
Removed `AsFieldFmt` trait and its implementations. `Bytes` type truncates its `Debug` output by default.
Optimized interactions with `Create` transaction to avoid unnecessary cloning of the bytecode.
