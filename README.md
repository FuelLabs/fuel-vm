The repository contains crates implementing the 
[FuelVM specification](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-specs/blob/master/src/fuel-vm/index.md) 
used by [fuel-core](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-core) 
and [the Sway compiler](https://github.com/FuelLabs/sway/).

| fuel-asm     | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fuel-asm)](https://crates.io/crates/fuel-asm)         | Contains the FuelVM instruction set - opcodes used by the Sway and VM.                                                                                                                                                             | 
| fuel-compression | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fuel-compression)](https://crates.io/crates/fuel-compression)   | DA-layer compression of Fuel transaction types | 
| fuel-crypto  | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fuel-crypto)](https://crates.io/crates/fuel-crypto)   | Cryptographic primitives used across Fuel Rust based projects.                                                                                                                                                                     | 
| fuel-merkle  | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fuel-merkle)](https://crates.io/crates/fuel-merkle)   | Implementations of the Merkle Tree used by the `fuel-core` to fulfill fraud proofs requirements, and `fuel-tx` to validate transaction validity.                                                                                   | 
| fuel-storage | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fuel-storage)](https://crates.io/crates/fuel-storage) | Storage abstraction is used to connect FuelVM, `fuel-merkle`, and `fuel-core` together without direct access.                                                                                                                      | 
| fuel-tx      | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fuel-tx)](https://crates.io/crates/fuel-tx)           | Contains a definition of types from the specification, with canonical serialization and deserialization. The `Transaction` and `Checked<Tx>` type implements fee calculation and validation of rules defined by the specification. | 
| fuel-types   | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fuel-types)](https://crates.io/crates/fuel-types)     | Atomic types are used by almost all Fuel Rust-based crates. The crate defines the most common entities and implements their serialization/deserialization.                                                                         | 
| fuel-vm      | [![crates.io](https://img.shields.io/crates/v/fuel-vm)](https://crates.io/crates/fuel-vm)           | The VM itself executes `fuel-asm` opcodes generated by the Sway compiler. It is used as a core component of the `fuel-core` block executor to validate, estimate, and execute `Create` and `Script` transactions.                  | 

## Testing

The [ci_checks.sh](ci_checks.sh) script file can be used to run all CI checks, 
including the running of tests.

```shell
source ci_checks.sh
```

The script requires pre-installed tools. For more information run:

```shell
cat ci_checks.sh
```

## Bug reporting and reproduction

If you find any bug or unexpected behavior, please open an issue. It would be helpful to provide a scenario of how to reproduce the problem:
- A text description of the problem(maybe with links)
- A runnable script with instruction
- A repository with reproduction code and instructions on how to compile/run
- A unit test with the usage of the pure opcodes from `fuel-asm`

### How to use pure opcodes

The `fuel-vm` has many [unit tests](https://github.com/FuelLabs/fuel-vm/tree/master/fuel-vm/src/tests), almost for each opcode.
Supporting a huge test codebase requires proper test utils that you can re-use to reproduce a bug.

#### Add a new test case

If a specific opcode has unexpected behaviors, maybe there is a unit test 
already that you can reuse to reproduce a bug. You need to add a new `test_case` like:

```rust
#[test_case(JumpMode::RelativeIS, 0, 0, 100 => Ok(4); "is-relative jump")]
```

Before the test and run this specific test or all tests.

#### Build custom scripts

If you need to write your own specific script and run it, you can use `test_helpers::run_script`.

For example:

```rust
#[test]
fn dynamic_call_frame_ops_bug_missing_ssp_check() {
    let ops = vec![
        op::cfs(RegId::SP),
        op::slli(0x10, RegId::ONE, 26),
        op::aloc(0x10),
        op::sw(RegId::ZERO, 0x10, 0),
        op::ret(RegId::ONE),
    ];
    let receipts = run_script(ops);
    assert_panics(&receipts, PanicReason::MemoryOverflow);
}
```

It returns `receipts` that contain result of execution. The `assert_panics` can be used to check for panics.

#### Build custom transactions

The `fuel-tx` provides `fuel_tx::TransactionBuilder` that simplifies the building 
of custom transaction for testing purposes.

You can check how `TransactionBuilder::script` or `TransactionBuilder::create` are used for better understanding.
