name: Test 0 Leaves
function_name: generate_test_0_leaves
description: Build a proof from a binary Merkle tree and manual set the number of leaves to 0. Setting the number of leaves to 0 implies that the source tree is empty. This proof is invalid because empty trees cannot produce a proof. Verification is expected to fail.
