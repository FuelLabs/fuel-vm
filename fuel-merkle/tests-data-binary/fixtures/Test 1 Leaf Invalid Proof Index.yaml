name: Test 1 Leaf Invalid Proof Index
function_name: generate_test_1_leaf_invalid_proof_index
description: Build a proof from a binary Merkle tree consisting of 1 leaf and manually set the leaf index to 1. Because the leaf index is zero-based, leaf index 1 refers to a position outside the range of the source tree. This proof is invalid because the leaf index is out of range. Verification is expected to fail.
