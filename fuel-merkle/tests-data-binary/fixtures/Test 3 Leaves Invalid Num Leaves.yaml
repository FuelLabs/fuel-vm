name: Test 3 Leaves Invalid Num Leaves
function_name: generate_test_3_leaf_invalid_num_leaves
description: Build a proof from a binary Merkle tree consisting of 3 leaves and manually set the number of leaves to 4. This proof is invalid because the proof reports 4 leaves when it was generated from a tree with 3 leaves. Verification is expected to fail.
